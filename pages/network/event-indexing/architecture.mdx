# Penumbra events pipeline

Here's an architecture diagram, describing how ABCI Events work in Penumbra.

## Software components

There are several components in play:

* [pd](../node/pd/), the Penumbra daemon
* [pindexer](./pindexer.md), used to enrich event data with Penumbra-specific AppViews
* [penumbra-reindexer](./reindexer.md), used to collect historical event data
* Databases in both PostgreSQL and SQLite formats

How you host these services is up you. If the application you intend to support requires
event data, then you'll need to provide [pindexer](./pindexer.md). Running the [reindexer](./reindexer.md)
is optional, but will provide a more resilient service over time.
