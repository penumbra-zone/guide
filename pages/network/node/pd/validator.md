# Becoming a validator

After [starting your node](./join-network.md), you should now be participating in the
network as a fullnode. If you wish to run a validator, you'll need to perform additional
steps.

Every validator on Penumbra is a fullnode that has been "promoted" to validator status.
Make sure you are comfortable running a fullnode before you attempt to run a validator,
because validators are subject to penalties for downtime.

## Validator definitions in Penumbra

A validator definition contains fields defining metadata regarding your
validator as well as funding streams, which are Penumbra's analogue to validator
commissions.

The root of a validator's identity is their _identity key_. Currently, `pcli`
reuses the spend authorization key in whatever wallet is active as the
validator's identity key. This key is used to sign validator definitions that
update the configuration for a validator.

**IMPORTANT:** The validator identity _cannot be changed, ever!_ This means that if you are running
a production validator, you _definitely_ should use a secure custody setup for the wallet which
backs the identity key. Strongly consider using the `threshold` backend of `pcli` for this purpose.
More details about validator custody can be found under the [validator
custody](../../pcli/wallet.md#validator-custody) section of the `pcli` guide.

#### Creating a template definition

First, make sure you've [installed `pcli`](../../pcli/install.md).
To create a template configuration, use `pcli validator definition template`:

```shell
$ pcli validator definition template \
    --tendermint-validator-keyfile ~/.penumbra/network_data/node0/cometbft/config/priv_validator_key.json \
    --file validator.toml
$ cat validator.toml
# This is a template for a validator definition.
#
# The identity_key and governance_key fields are auto-filled with values derived
# from this wallet's account.
#
# You should fill in the name, website, and description fields.
#
# By default, validators are disabled, and cannot be delegated to. To change
# this, set `enabled = true`.
#
# Every time you upload a new validator config, you'll need to increment the
# `sequence_number`.

sequence_number = 0
enabled = false
name = ''
website = ''
description = ''
identity_key = 'penumbravalid1kqrecmvwcc75rvg9arhl0apsggtuannqphxhlzl34vfamp4ukg9q87ejej'
governance_key = 'penumbragovern1kqrecmvwcc75rvg9arhl0apsggtuannqphxhlzl34vfamp4ukg9qus84v5'

[consensus_key]
type = 'tendermint/PubKeyEd25519'
value = 'HDmm2FmJhLHxaKPnP5Fw3tC1DtlBx8ETgTL35UF+p6w='

[[funding_stream]]
recipient = 'penumbrav2t1cntf73e36y3um4zmqm4j0zar3jyxvyfqxywwg5q6fjxzhe28qttppmcww2kunetdp3q2zywcakwv6tzxdnaa3sqymll2gzq6zqhr5p0v7fnfdaghrr2ru2uw78nkeyt49uf49q'
rate_bps = 100

[[funding_stream]]
recipient = "CommunityPool"
rate_bps = 100
```

and adjust the data like the name, website, description, etc as desired.

The `enabled` field can be used to enable/disable your validator without facing slashing
penalties. Disabled validators can not appear in the active validator set and are ineligible for
rewards.

This is useful if, for example, you know your validator will not be online for a period of time,
and you want to avoid an uptime violation penalty. If you are uploading your validator for the
first time, you will likely want to start with it disabled until your CometBFT & `pd`
instances have caught up to the consensus block height.

Note that by default the `enabled` field is set to false and will need to be
enabled in order to activate one's validator.

In the default template, there is a funding stream declared to [contribute funds to the
Community Pool](../../pcli/governance.md#contributing-to-the-community-pool). This is not required, and may be altered or
removed if you wish.

#### Setting the consensus key

In the command above, the `--tendermint-validator-keyfile` flag was used to instruct
`pcli` to import the consensus key for the CometBFT identity. This works well
if `pcli` and `pd` are used on the same machine. If you are running them in separate
environments, you can omit the flag, and `pd` will generate a random key in the template.
You must then **manually update the `consensus_key`**. You can get the correct value
for `consensus_key` from your `cometbft` configs:

```shell
$ grep -A3 pub_key ~/.penumbra/network_data/node0/cometbft/config/priv_validator_key.json
  "pub_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
    "value": "Fodjg0m1kF/6uzcAZpRcLJswGf3EeNShLP2A+UCz8lw="
  },
```

Copy the string in the `value` field and paste that into your `validator.toml`,
as the `value` field under the `[consensus_key]` heading.

#### Configuring funding streams

Unlike the Cosmos SDK, which has validators specify a commission percentage that
goes to the validator, Penumbra uses _funding streams_, a list of pairs of
commission amounts and addresses. This design allows validators to dedicate
portions of their commission non-custodially -- for instance, a validator could
declare some amount of commission to cover their operating costs, and another
that would be sent to an address controlled by the Community Pool.

## Uploading a definition

After setting up metadata, funding streams, and the correct consensus key in
your `validator.toml`, you can upload it to the chain:

```console
pcli validator definition upload --file validator.toml
```

And verify that it's known to the chain:

```console
pcli query validator list --show-inactive
```

However your validator doesn't have anything delegated to it and will remain in
an `Inactive` state until it receives enough delegations to place it in the
active set of validators.

## Delegating to your validator

First find your validator's identity key:

```console
pcli validator identity
```

And then delegate some amount of `penumbra` to it:

```console
pcli tx delegate 1penumbra --to [YOUR_VALIDATOR_IDENTITY_KEY]
```

You should then see your balance of `penumbra` decreased and that you have received some amount of delegation tokens for your validator:

```console
pcli view balance
```

Voting power will be calculated on the next epoch transition after your
delegation takes place. Assuming that your delegation was enough to place your
validator in the top N validators by voting power, it should appear in the
validator list as `Active` after the next epoch transition. The epoch duration
and the active validator limit are chain parameters, and will vary by
deployment. You can find the values in use for the current chain in its
`genesis.json` file.

## Updating your validator

First fetch your existing validator definition from the chain:

```console
pcli validator definition fetch --file validator.toml
```

Then make any changes desired and **make sure to increase `sequence_number` by at least 1!**
The `sequence_number` is a unique, increasing identifier for the version of the validator definition.

After updating the validator definition you can upload it again to update your validator metadata on-chain:

```console
pcli validator definition upload --file validator.toml
```
