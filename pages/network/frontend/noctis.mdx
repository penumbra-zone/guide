# Cuiloa

[Cuiloa] is a block explorer for navigating and inspecting data on [Penumbra]. While Penumbra is a fully private
proof-of-stake network, Cuiloa allows you to explore the *public* facets of the Penumbra chain. Beyond just blocks and
transactions, Cuiloa lets you explore staking, governance, and DEX activity along with Penumbra's cross-chain
interactions via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) interoperability protocol, including established IBC clients
running on Penumbra and recent IBC packets.

## Deployment

Assuming you have cloned and entered the repository...

### Docker

For a dev instance of Cuiloa, a docker compose file is provided. Simply run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view a development instance of the app.

Cuiloa will soon have a production ready image that can be deploy in a standard docker (or podman) workflow. Until
then, please checkout manual configuration below.

### Manual Deployment

In addition to a local Penumbra Node and configured CometBFT indexer (more on that below), you will need to have
recent version of `node`, `npm`, and `postgresql` installed on the machine you are building and running Cuiloa.

#### PostgreSQL

With a modern version of PostgreSQL, create a database and initialize it with the schema file provided by `cometbft`
[here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/state/indexer/sink/psql/schema.sql). Assuming you've created
a database `$DB_NAME` and you have user permissions for the database, You can load a schema file using `psql` with the
following command:

```sh
psql -d $DB_NAME -f schema.sql
```

This will be our indexer that the block explorer uses for accessing information on blocks, events, and transactions
that occur on the chain. 

With the database initialized, create an .env file with the database's URI, i.e.:
```sh .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://DB_USER:DB_PASSWORD@localhost:DB_PORT/DB_NAME?sslmode=disable"
```

You will also need this information for the `config.toml` file that `cometbft` will be initialized with when creating
your own full node. More on that below.

#### Penumbra

You need to have a full node setup with penumbra (including `cometbft`) as detailed
[here](https://guide.penumbra.zone/node/pd/join-network). Alternatively, you can configure a full node on a devnet as
explained [here](https://guide.penumbra.zone/main/dev/devnet-quickstart.html). **In either case**, you need to modify
the `config.toml` file that is created by `pd` after generating your configuration files.

`config.toml` should be found under `$HOME/.penumbra/network_data/node0/cometbft/config/`. In this file, there is a
heading `[tx_index]` with the configuration variable of `indexer = "kv"`. Using the URI of the database you created
with PostgreSQL from the previous section, you need to update the section under `[tx_index]` to the following:

```toml
[tx_index]
indexer = "psql"
psql-conn = "$YOUR_DB_URI_HERE"
```
After you have updated this file, you should start the full node as instructed by the Penumbra guide. If everything was
configured correctly, you should be able to open the database and inspect for Block and Transaction events. If there is
no data, check the logs for `cometbft` for any errors with inserting data into the indexer.

#### Building Cuiloa

If you are only interested in running a development version of Cuiloa, you can simply run `npm run dev` at this point
and head to `localhost:3000` to view the application.

For a production build, ensure that the `output` option in `next.config.js` is either commented out or deleted
**unless** you are building Cuiloa for an optimized image. If you are planning on running Cuiloa as an image, you need
to follow NextJS's [instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output#automatically-copying-traced-files)
for correctly building and copying over its dependencies.

Assuming you are using a normal build on your machine, you can now run `npm run build && npm run start`. If everything
has been configured correctly, you can visit `localhost:3000` to view your local production release of Cuiloa.
