# Using Penumbra from the command line

This section describes how to use `pcli`, the command line client for Penumbra:

- [Installation](./pcli/install.md) describes how to compile and run `pcli`.
- [Generating a Wallet](./pcli/wallet.md) describes how to generate a wallet.
- [Viewing Balances](./pcli/balance.md) describes how to view balances.
- [Sending Transactions](./pcli/transaction.md) describes how to send funds.

Penumbra is a private blockchain, so the public chain state does not reveal any
private user data.  By default, `pcli` includes a _view service_ that
synchronizes with the chain and scans with a viewing key.

### Please submit any feedback and bug reports

Thank you for helping us test the Penumbra network! If you have any feedback, please let us know in
the `#general` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hKvkrqa3zC). We would love to know about bugs, crashes,
confusing error messages, or any of the many other things that inevitably won't quite work yet. Have
fun! :)
