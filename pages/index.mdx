# Welcome to Penumbra

Penumbra is a fully private, cross-chain proof-of-stake network and
decentralized exchange for the Cosmos and beyond. Penumbra brings privacy to
IBC, allowing anyone to shield any IBC asset just by transferring it into
Penumbra's multi-asset shielded pool.  Within Penumbra, users can transact,
stake, swap, or marketmake without broadcasting their personal information to
the world.  Unlike a transparent chain, where all information is public,
Penumbra is end-to-end encrypted.
