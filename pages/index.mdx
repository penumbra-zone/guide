# Welcome to Penumbra

Penumbra is a fully private, cross-chain proof-of-stake L1 blockchain and
decentralized exchange for the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. Penumbra brings privacy to
[IBC](https://ibcprotocol.dev/), allowing anyone to shield any IBC asset just by transferring it into
Penumbra's interchain shielded pool.  Within Penumbra, users can transact,
stake, swap, or marketmake without broadcasting their personal information to
the world.  Unlike a transparent chain, where all information is public,
Penumbra is end-to-end encrypted, and transactions are shielded by default.
