# Interchain privacy

Penumbra stores all value in a single _interchain shielded pool_ that can record
any asset from any IBC-connected chain. Penumbra's shielded pool was inspired by
the Zcash design, but with modifications that allow seamless interoperability
across chains.

<Steps>

### Deposit

To deposit tokens into Penumbra's shielded pool, users initiate an ordinary IBC
transfer from any connected chain, with a Penumbra address as the receiver.

### Transact Privately

Once tokens are held in Penumbra's shielded pool, users can transact privately
on Penumbra: transfer, trade, swap, stake, or vote.  Transactions within Penumbra
are shielded, and don't reveal a user's information to the world.

### Withdraw

To withdraw tokens from Penumbra's shielded pool, users initiate an outbound IBC
transfer to any connected chain.  Their activity on the other chain is public,
as they have left the shielded pool.

</Steps>

Penumbra is designed to align the privacy boundary with the IBC boundary:
transfers into Penumbra shield funds, and transfers out of Penumbra unshield
funds.  To maximize privacy, users should store their funds on Penumbra, then
withdraw as needed to perform actions on other chains.

## Penumbra is Built Different

Achieving end-user privacy required reimagining how blockchains should be built.
Here's what you need to know:

### End-to-End and Local-First

Penumbra transactions are end-to-end encrypted, visible only to the sender and
receiver (and anyone they choose to disclose to), but not to the public.  Instead of executing transactions on-chain, user data like an account balance is
updated locally, then submitted to the chain encrypted, with client-side zero-knowledge (ZK)
proving to ensure the encrypted updates are correct.

But this means there's no RPC that can tell you what your balance is, as that
information is visible only to you.  So Penumbra is designed to enable
_ultralight nodes_ that scan, sync, decrypt and locally index the data visible
to a specific wallet.  These are lightweight enough to run on any device, like a
browser or a phone, and are embedded in wallet software like [Prax
Wallet](./web/prax.mdx) or [`pcli`](./pcli.md).  Imagine a personal indexer,
just for your own transactions, embedded in every wallet. This is a Penumbra
ultralight node.

### Wallets, Accounts, Addresses

On a transparent chain, each signing key typically controls one account with one address.
This means that giving out an address doesn't just let someone send you funds.
It also means giving them the ability to view all of your token balances and all
of your past and future transaction history.

Instead, Penumbra separates these concepts:

* An **address**, `penumbra1...`, only allows _sending_ funds to a receiver, not viewing their balances.
* An **account** is a logical bucket of funds with its own balance. Each account has a default address, and many randomized _IBC deposit addresses_, all pointing at the same balances.
* A **wallet** is a group of accounts, all controlled by the same signing key.

Each seed phrase generates a single wallet, controlling many numbered accounts,
each with many addresses.  To allow users to keep track, Penumbra addresses
include encrypted metadata visible only to the wallet that controls them.  From
the outside, all Penumbra addresses are indistinguishable from each other. But
the user who controls the address can decrypt the metadata and learn about the
account information.  This provides better UX than existing systems, where each
account must be generated sequentially.

**IBC deposit addresses** allow increased privacy when making IBC transfers into
and out of Penumbra.  Because an IBC deposit is initiated on the (public)
counterparty chain, it reveals the destination address.  This could allow
linking different inbound transfers if the same address was used multiple times.
Instead, Penumbra clients should automatically generate a new IBC deposit
address for each transfer to ensure deposits are not linkable.  This is not a
problem for transfers _within_ Penumbra, where addresses are not revealed
anyways.

#### Inspecting Addresses

Users can inspect any address using their wallet software to see whether they
control it.  Penumbra frontends should render address views by default, but this
may be useful when inspecting transactions elsewhere.

For example, using Prax:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', marginTop: '1em' }}>
  <img src="./images/inspect-1.png" style={{ width: '33.33%' }} />
  <img src="./images/inspect-3.png" style={{ width: '33.33%' }} />
  <img src="./images/inspect-2.png" style={{ width: '33.33%' }} />
</div>
