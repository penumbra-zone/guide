# Quest

## Setup a wallet

In order to interact with Penumbra, you need a compatible wallet. One such option is Prax Wallet. Visit the link and click Add to Chrome to install it, then come back to this page.

Great! You've now installed the Prax Wallet extension.

Open it by clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar, select Create a new wallet. During the guided tutorial, you'll need to set a passphrase to protect your wallet. The passphrase is not the same as the recovery phrase. The passphrase is used to restrict access to the web wallet on your computer. The recovery phrase can be used to restore your wallet in case you forget your passphrase, switch to a new machine or delete the extension. Make sure to store both the passphrase and the recovery phrase securely, for example in a password manager. Re-enter portions of the recovery phrase when prompted, to confirm that you've saved it properly.

Before you connect your wallet, websites cannot access any of your data. It's all stored locally and securely on your device. To give a site permission to access your data, click the Connect button below.

## Deposit funds

Now it's time to shield your funds and transfer them into Penumbra. Pick an account from Prax by clicking the extension icon, click the IBC Deposit Address checkbox, and copy the address.

<Callout type="info">
  IBC Deposit addresses exist because source chains record the deposit address. They serve as an additional layer of anonymity to not link your deposit and actual addresses.
</Callout>

We will use [Skip Protocol](https://go.skip.build/)  to bridge funds into Penumbra. Go to the Skip app, and input your IBC Deposit address. Select your source chain and asset (we recommend USDC, but any common asset is fine) and select Penumbra and USDC as the destination chain. Then initiate the deposit and come back to this page.

<Callout type="info">
  Penumbra supports paying fees in multiple tokens, including USDC. Prax will always choose the best token to pay fees with depending on your balances.
