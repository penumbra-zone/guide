# Getting Started

This quick start guide will help you get started with Penumbra using a web-based wallet, and walk you through each basic feature.

<Steps>

### Install Prax Wallet

To get started, [install Prax Wallet](https://praxwallet.com), then open it from the Chrome extensions toolbar to create a wallet.

<WalletInstallSteps/>

Connected sites, like this one, can view your addresses and balances:

<Balances/>

### Shield Funds

Transfers into Penumbra shield funds, recording them privately.

<Deposit/>

### Swap

<Swap/>

### Stake

<Staking/>

### Sending Tokens

Use the [Send](https://stake.with.starlingcyber.net/#/send) page to send tokens privately within Penumbra.

Penumbra transactions include a shielded memo describing the purpose of the transaction. The memo is only visible to the sender and receiver of the transaction.

You can test sending tokens to one of your other sub-accounts by using the arrows on the account selector in the extension popup to select a different sub-account.

### Vote

UM stakers can participate in governance using [https://void.vote/](https://void.vote/).
This frontend allows viewing proposals, and voting on them through the Prax wallet.

### Disconnecting Frontends

To revoke a site's access to your data, navigate to the Settings page in
Prax Wallet, click Connected Sites, and click the trash button next to
the site's URL.

You can do this now to `https://guide.penumbra.zone` to verify that
disconnection cuts off this page's access to your data.
