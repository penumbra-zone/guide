# Prax Wallet

This section describes how to use the Prax Wallet web extension, an official GUI client for Penumbra.

Currently, the web extension only supports a subset of functionality of the
command-line client, [`pcli`](./pcli.md).

## Installing the extension

The Penumbra Wallet web extension only supports the Google Chrome browser.
You must run Chrome in order to follow the instructions below.

Visit the Web Store page to download the [Prax Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prax-wallet/lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe), and click **Add to Chrome** to install it.

## Generating a wallet

When you first open the extension, you'll be offered to import a pre-existing wallet. If you don't already have one, choose **Create a new wallet**.
During the guided tutorial, you'll need to set a passphrase to protect your wallet. The passphrase
is *not* the same as the recovery phrase. The passphrase is used to restrict access to the web wallet
on your computer. The recovery phrase can be used to import your wallet on a fresh installation, or
on a different machine. Make sure to store both the passphrase and the recovery phrase
securely, for example in a password manager.

Re-enter portions of the recovery phrase when prompted, to confirm that you've saved it properly.

## Select your preferred RPC endpoint

Once you import or generate a wallet, you will be prompted to select an RPC endpoint, which is the URL the extension uses to sync with the network. 
These are hosted by the community (including yourself, if you like), and those provided in the UI are typically offered by known validators.
You may also provide your own custom endpoint, whether that is a community provider not provided as a default option, or hosted on a node you run yourself.

## Select your preferred frontend app

The extension will prompt you to select a frontend app to use with the wallet. This is a web interface that you will use to interact with the blockchain.
The provided options are community-hosted frontends, and you may also provide your own custom frontend URL.
Connecting a frontend to your wallet grants the frontend provider a full viewing key for your wallet in order to decrypt and display relevant information, such as your wallet balance. 
*This means that the front-end provider has read access (only) to your wallet and all of its activity.* This is necessary for the encrypted data on-chain to be parsed and rendered in a human-readable format.
However, this means that you should only connect to frontend providers that you trust, because they can see any actions taken by the connected wallet by using the provided full viewing key.
If you desire greater privacy than this provides, you can always run your own frontend, or utilize the command-line client, [`pcli`](./pcli.md), to interact with the blockchain directly.

## Updating to a new version of the extension

The extension should be automatically updated every time a new version is released.
You can view the latest version of the extension on the [Prax Wallet] page at the
Chrome Web Store. To force a check for updates:

1. Click the three-dot icon in the top right corner of the browser.
2. From the drop-down menu, choose **Extensions -> Manage Extensions**.
3. Select **Update** on the top panel.

After updating the extension manually, it may be helpful to clear the local cache,
as described above.
