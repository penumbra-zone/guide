# Prax Wallet Interactive Guide

Welcome to the interactive guide for the Prax Wallet web extension, a browser
wallet extension for Penumbra.  Prax Wallet is open-source software
that runs entirely on your computer.

This step-by-step tutorial is designed to help you navigate and use the Prax Wallet effectively.
Please follow each section in order to ensure the best experience.

## Installing the extension

The Prax Wallet web extension only supports the Google Chrome browser.
You must run Chrome in order to follow the instructions below.

Visit the [Prax Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prax-wallet/lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe) page in the Chrome Web Store, and click **Add to Chrome** to install it. Then, come back to this page.

## Generating a wallet

When you first open the extension, you'll be offered to import a pre-existing wallet. If you don't already have one, choose **Create a new wallet**.

This will guide you through the process of creating a **recovery seed phrase**. This is a list of 12 or 24 words that can be used to restore your wallet in case you forget your password, switch to a new machine, or delete the extension.

During the guided tutorial, you'll also need to set a password to protect your wallet. The password
is *not* the same as the recovery seed phrase. The password is used to restrict access to the web wallet
on your computer.

Make sure to store both the password and the recovery seed phrase securely, for example in a password manager.

Re-enter portions of the recovery seed phrase when prompted, to confirm that you've saved it properly.

## Select your preferred RPC endpoint

Prax Wallet needs a way to connect to the blockchain. This is done by selecting a **RPC endpoint**, which is the URL the extension uses to sync with the network. These are hosted by the community (including yourself, if you like), and those provided in the UI are typically offered by known validators.

By default, Prax Wallet will select a public RPC endpoint. You can change the endpoint at any time, by clicking on the Prax Wallet extension icon in the Chrome toolbar, and selecting the Settings menu in the upper left corner. Then, select **RPC**:

From there, you can select a default endpoint, or choose **Custom RPC** to specify your own endpoint, whether that is a community provider not provided as a default option, or hosted on a node you run yourself.

## Select your preferred frontend app

By default, Prax Wallet will select a frontend app to use with the wallet. This is a web interface that you will use to interact with the blockchain.

The provided options are community-hosted frontends, and you may also provide your own custom frontend URL. You can change the frontend app at any time, by clicking on the Prax Wallet extension icon in the Chrome toolbar, and selecting the Settings menu in the upper left corner. Then, select **Default Frontend**:

This will take you to a page where you can select a default frontend, or choose **Custom frontend** to specify your own frontend URL.

Connecting a frontend to your wallet grants the frontend provider a full viewing key for your wallet in order to decrypt and display relevant information, such as your wallet balance.
*This means that the front-end provider has read access (only, meaning that they cannot spend your funds) to your wallet and all of its activity.* This is necessary for the encrypted data on-chain to be parsed and rendered in a human-readable format. See [Selective Disclosure](/disclosure) for more information on viewing keys.

However, this means that you should only connect to frontend providers that you trust, because they can see any actions taken by the connected wallet by using the provided full viewing key.
If you desire greater privacy than this provides, you can always run your own frontend, or utilize the command-line client, [`pcli`](./pcli.md), to interact with the blockchain directly.

## Updating to a new version of the extension

The extension should be automatically updated every time a new version is released.
You can view the latest version of the extension on the [Prax Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prax-wallet/lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe) page at the Chrome Web Store. To force a check for updates:
