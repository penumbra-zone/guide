# Shielding Funds

To shield funds originating on other chains, you can use the IBC transfer feature in the Prax Wallet, found under the `Shield Funds` tab.
This feature allows you to send tokens from other chains into Penumbra's shielded pool, where they will benefit from Penumbra's enhanced privacy and become available to use on the DEX.
For incoming transfers to the shielded pool, you must connect a wallet from a counterparty chain to the Prax Wallet, and then initiate the transfer from the counterparty chain's wallet.
To unshield funds, you can use the `Shield Funds` tab to send tokens from Penumbra to another chain, by selecting a counterparty chain and destination address and clicking `Unshield Assets`.
