# Staking

If you hold the staking token `UM` you can delegate, or stake, those tokens to a validator. This enables
you to receive rewards and participate in governance in exchange for taking on the risk of validator misbehavior.

To stake with Prax, first ensure you hold the Penumbra protocol's staking token `UM`.

Next, select the `Stake` tab on your frontend.

On the `Stake` tab, you can see how much `UM` you have available to delegate, along with a list of possible validators.
For each validator, you will see some important data:

* `VP`: the voting power of the validator in the governance system,
* `Com`: the commission rate that validator takes.

Once you select a validator to stake with, you can click the `Delegate` button.

Select how much `UM` you wish to delegate, then press `Delegate`:

It will take a few moments for the delegation transaction to be prepared, then Prax will generate a view of your
transaction. Verify one of the outputs is to the validator you selected, then click `Approve`:

You should see a pop-up in the lower right hand of the page indicating that the transaction was approved!

You will receive the delegation token associated with that validator. At a later point, you can undelegate by clicking the `Undelegate` button
to undelegate from that validator, and receive staking tokens.
