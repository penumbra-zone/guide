# Viewing Balances

## Viewing Balances in Prax

Prax Wallet displays your balance per account. Simply click the Prax icon in the Chrome toolbar and you will see your **Main Account**:

The balances are displayed by asset type. For example, here we see the balance of the main account includes Penumbra's staking token UM, as well as ATOM.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">Recall that in Penumbra, your wallet has multiple **Accounts**, and each account has many **Shielded Addresses**. See [Interchain Privacy](/interchain-privacy) for more details.</Callout>

By clicking the arrow to the right, you can view the balances and default addresses, of the other accounts in your wallet:

You also have a toggle for generating a IBC deposit address for the account:

![Prax Balances IBC Deposit Address](/images/prax-balances-account1-ibc.png)

This is an important feature for privacy when making IBC transfers in and out of Penumbra. Because an IBC deposit is initiated on the (public) counterparty chain, it reveals the destination Penumbra address. This could allow linking different inbound transfers if the same address was used multiple times. Instead, Prax Wallet will generate a fresh IBC deposit address every time you toggle the "IBC Deposit Address" option. You can try this by toggling it multiple times, and you'll notice a new address each time.

## Viewing Balances in the Frontend

The default Penumbra frontend, [app.penumbra.zone](https://app.penumbra.zone), also displays your balances in a similar way to Prax Wallet. Each account is displayed along with its assets below:

## Inspecting Transactions in the frontend

You can also inspect transactions in the frontend by clicking on the transactions tab:

![Frontend Transactions](/images/frontend-transactions.png)

This will take you to the transaction history for your wallet. Each transaction in the list involved one of your wallet's accounts. By clicking on a transaction, you can view more details:

![Frontend Transaction - Private view](/images/frontend-tx-private.png)

This shows the transaction's private details, as well as the public details, which are visible to everyone. If you want to see how your transaction looks to others, you can toggle to the public view:

![Frontend Transaction - Public view](/images/frontend-tx-public.png)

You can see in this simple send transaction, the public details don't reveal anything other than the transaction fee.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">The transaction fee being public in transfers is why we recommend using the UM staking token for privacy. By using other assets to pay fees, you may not blend in with other Penumbra users.</Callout>
