# Viewing Balances

To view your balance, simply navigate to the `Assets` tab in the frontend site you are using. The balance of your wallet will be displayed there, separated by asset type.
Here you may also toggle into a `Transactions` view, which will allow you to see the connected wallet's transaction history, and dive into their transaction details.

Connected sites can also query your data, so if you connected your wallet, this guide can also show your balances:
