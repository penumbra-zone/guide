# Governance

Penumbra users and stakeholders coordinate through the governance process to express their opinions on the future of the protocol. Anyone who holds UM can submit a proposal, and only users with staked UM can vote on proposals. Users must have had staked UM *at the time of proposal submission* to vote on a proposal.

## Voting Frontend

Penumbra has a community-built governance frontend at [void.vote](https://void.vote).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only delegators can use [void.vote](https://void.vote). Validators must use [`pcli`](../pcli.mdx) to submit validator votes.
</Callout>

### Proposals

This frontend displays all historical proposals and all current proposals:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Proposals](/images/void_vote_proposal_list.png)
</div>

It displays whether or not the proposal passed for historical proposals. It also displays the full text of each proposal, as well as details such as the voting period in block height and the deposit provided:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Proposal Details](/images/void_vote_proposal_detail.png)
</div>

This deposit amount is refunded to the proposer, unless the proposal is slashed.

### Connecting

You can connect your wallet to the frontend by clicking the **Connect Wallet** button in the top left corner:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Connect Wallet](/images/void_vote_connect_wallet.png)
</div>

You will need to approve this action in Prax Wallet:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Approve Connection](/images/void_vote_approval.png)
</div>

After approving, if you held staked UM at the time of proposal submission, you will be able to vote on that proposal.

### Voting

There are three vote options:

* Yes
* No
* Abstain

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you do not vote on a proposal, the vote of the validator you delegated to will be used.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  There is no "No With Veto" option in Penumbra. Instead, if a proposal gets more than 80% no votes, it will be slashed, and the proposal will lose the deposit they used to submit the proposal.
</Callout>

You vote by clicking the vote option you want to select in the **Vote** section. You cannot change your vote after you have submitted it!

You can see the current tally of votes on a proposal in the **Vote Tally** section:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Voting Tally](/images/void_vote_tally.png)
</div>

After voting, you will receive a special token, called a voting receipt, which will be displayed in the **Your Voting Receipt Tokens** section of the frontend. If you didn't vote on a specific proposal, you will see:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  ![Voting Receipt](/images/void_vote_receipts.png)
</div>
