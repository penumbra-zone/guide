# Providing Liquidity

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Liquidity provision involves risk. This section describes how to use software tools, but your trading strategies are solely up to you.
</Callout>

Penumbra's DEX is built around order-book-style concentrated liquidity.
Liquidity positions are constant-sum AMMs, offering to trade between assets at a
fixed price.  Each position is its own independent AMM with its own fee tier,
and as described in the [DEX chapter](./dex.mdx), the DEX engine indexes active
liquidity positions and sorts them by price, then traverses the liquidity graph
to optimally fill trades. 

Liquidity positions are public, but are created out of and withdrawn back to
Penumbra's shielded pool. Thus, while everyone can see the aggregate state of
the market, they cannot see which positions are controlled by which accounts, or
view an account's trading history or strategy (unless they have access to that
account's viewing key).

## Liquidity Positions

The data of a liquidity position is contained in the [`Position`
message](https://buf.build/penumbra-zone/penumbra/docs/main:penumbra.core.component.dex.v1#penumbra.core.component.dex.v1.Position).
At a high level, this consists of:

- the position's _trading function_, which specifies:
  - the trading pair (order-independent, as assets 1 and 2 are ordered by asset ID);
  - the trading function, via parameters `p` and `q`;
  - the percentage fee applied to trades;
- the position's reserves, `R_1` and `R_2`;
- a `close_on_fill` boolean, controlling whether the position is closed when a trade completely consumes either `R_1` or `R_2`.

The trading function for the CFMM is:
```
phi(R_1, R_2) = p * R_1 + q * R_2
```

A trade is accepted when `phi(R_1, R_2) = phi(R_1', R_2')`, so the ratio of `p`
and `q` determines the trading price. For instance, if the position is
initialized with reserves `(0, R_2)`, the position will accept a trade that
updates its reserves to `R_1 = (q/p)*R_2`. In other words, the position is
offering up to `R_2` of asset 2 at price `q/p`. More details can be found in the
[Concentrated
Liquidity](https://protocol.penumbra.zone/main/dex/concentrated_liquidity.html)
section of the protocol specification.

The DEX engine indexes positions by pair and by effective price (inclusive of
fee tier) and routes trades across the liquidity graph. More details on routing
can be found in the [On-chain
Routing](https://protocol.penumbra.zone/main/dex/routing.html) section of the
protocol specification.

## Position Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a liquidity position is:
<Steps>

### Opened

On creation (by a [`PositionOpen` action][poa]), the position is in the "opened" state, in which it is actively
providing liquidity to the DEX engine. Trade executions against the position
update its reserves.

### Closed

An opened position can be closed explicitly, by a user-submitted
[`PositionClose` action][pca], or implicitly by the chain, if the [`Position`][position_proto]'s
`close_on_fill` field is set to `true` and the position's reserves were completely consumed by a trade.

When a position is closed, it no longer provides liquidity to the DEX and becomes "inert".

### Withdrawn

Closing a position does not immediately withdraw funds, because Penumbra
transactions (like any ZK transaction model) are early-binding: the prover must
know the state transition they prove knowledge of, and they cannot know the
final reserves with certainty until after the position has been deactivated.

Instead, reserves are explicitly withdrawn following closure. 

</Steps>

Control over liquidity positions is recorded using LPNFTs that track both the
position ID and its state. This allows using the transaction's value balance mechanism to
track the state machine:

- the `PositionOpen` action consumes the initial reserves and produces an "opened-LPNFT";
- the `PositionClose` action consumes an opened-LPNFT and produces a "closed-LPNFT";
- the `PositionWithdraw` action consumes a closed- or withdrawn-LPNFT and produces a withdrawn-LPNFT with an incremented withdrawal sequence number and any reserves withdrawn from the position.

The protocol supports withdrawing from a position multiple times, though there
is currently no reason to do this as the reserves are consumed on the first
withdrawal.  

This design opens interesting possibilities not possible on a conventional DEX:

- **Block-scoped JIT liquidity**: a position can be opened and closed in the same transaction. As the opening is processed in a batch in the first phase of the DEX `EndBlock` handler and the closure is processed in a batch following all trade executions, this allows a liquidity provider to quote a price and be guaranteed that it will only be valid for a single block's batch executions.

- **Replicating Market Makers**: the payoff function of any CFMM can be approximated via constant-sum AMMs, allowing market makers to replicate whatever trading function they want. This functionality is implemented in `pcli` for two strategies: a linear spread across a range, and an approximation of the payoff of an `xy=k` (UniV2) curve.

## Managing Liquidity Positions
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There is currently no GUI support for managing liquidity positions.
</Callout>

### Individual limit orders with `pcli`

`pcli` can create positions replicating limit order behavior using `pcli tx lp order buy` and `pcli tx lp order sell`. For instance:
```
pcli tx lp order sell 100gm@1gn # sells 100 gm at 1 gn per gm
pcli tx lp order sell 100gm@1gn/50bps # sells 100gm at 1 gn per gm, with 50bps fee
```
These positions will remain open following execution. For instance, if a user traded `100gn` to `gm` against the first position, its new reserves would be `100gn`, which it would offer at `1gm/gn`. If this is not desired, the `--auto-close` parameter can be used:
```
pcli tx lp order sell 100gm@1gn --auto-close # sells 100 gm at 1 gn per gm, closing on fill
```
A "buy" order can also be expressed using `lp order buy`:
```
pcli tx lp order buy 100gm@2gn --auto-close # sells 200gn at 0.5gm per gn, closing on fill
```
There is no actual distinction at the protocol level between "buy" and "sell"
orders; this command will create a position with initial reserves of `200gn`,
equivalent to
```
pcli tx lp order sell 200gn@0.5gm --auto-close
```
Owned positions can be queried with `pcli v balance`.
Positions can be closed and withdrawn individually or all at once:
```
pcli tx lp close plpid1tvj0vpdxhuu0tjxsskgf05f6l6dp0xqjqvywptrs0flvvvhvecjqtaxvf7
pcli tx lp withdraw plpid1tvj0vpdxhuu0tjxsskgf05f6l6dp0xqjqvywptrs0flvvvhvecjqtaxvf7
pcli tx lp close-all
pcli tx lp withdraw-all
```

### Range liquidity with `pcli`

As of `v0.80.1`, `pcli` can compute a set of positions that spread liquidity
across a price range.  To do this, use
```
pcli tx lp replicate linear --help
```
This strategy takes a number of parameters (see `--help` for details), most importantly:

- the trading pair
- the lower bound of the price range
- the upper bound of the price range
- the fee tier for the positions

For example, the following invocation will create 5 positions spread across the range `1.8` to `2.2` USDC per UM:
```
$ pcli tx lp replicate linear upenumbra:transfer/channel-2/uusdc 100000000transfer/channel-2/uusdc --lower-price 1.8 --upper-price 2.2 --fee-bps 100 --num-positions 5

The portfolio value function of this strategy (not accounting for fees) can be visualized as follows:
<picture>
  <img src="./images/pvf-linear.png" />
</picture>

The x-axis shows the price of `UM` in terms of `USDC`, and the y-axis shows the
value of the position in the presence of traders (i.e., assuming the portfolio
always holds the less valuable asset, as a trader will trade away the more
valuable asset).  The lower part of the chart shows the value of each individual
liquidity position. When the market price is less than the position's price, the
position holds UM, so the position's value increases with the price of UM up to
its sell price, at which point the position's value is constant. The upper part
of the chart shows the combined PVF of the portfolio of positions (in blue), as
well as the PVF of a UniV3 position in the same range for reference. Notice that
even with only 5 positions, the portfolio value fairly closely approximates the
UniV3 curve.

This can be understood as a special case of some of the contents of the
[Replicating Market Makers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) paper.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`pcli` currently has limited support for external asset metadata, **including denom exponents**. Double-check proposed positions to be sure they're not mispriced by a factor of 1,000,000.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
`pcli` can load an external registry of asset metadata, placed in `$PCLI_HOME/registry.json`. The Prax wallet registry can be downloaded via
```
wget -O PATH/TO/PCLI_HOME/registry.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prax-wallet/registry/main/registry/chains/penumbra-1.json
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Even using an external registry, `pcli` cannot use it to parse command-line arguments, due to limitations that will be removed in a future release.  

Thus it is necessary to specify `upenumbra:transfer/channel-2/uusdc` (the base denom for both assets, so that the specified prices are 1.8 `upenumbra` per `uusdc`, not 1.8 `penumbra` per `uusdc`, a _very_ different price) and `100000000transfer/channel-2/uusdc`.

This limitation will be removed in a future release.

</Callout>

Programmatic access to a wallet's private state and transaction construction is
possible using `pclientd`. See the [`pclientd` section](./node/pclientd.md) of
the guide for details. This allows client software to work only with a local
GRPC endpoint and not have to worry about any Penumbra-specific cryptography or
ZK proving.
