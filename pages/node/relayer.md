# IBC relayer

In order for Penumbra to interact with the broader [Cosmos] ecosystem, the community must
run [IBC] relaying software, to transmit packets between chains. Relaying is by design
permissionless. Some examples of relayer software are:

  * [hermes], maintained by [Informal Systems]
  * [relayer], maintained by [Strangelove]

This guide provides a tutorial for [setting up Hermes for use with Penumbra](relayer/hermes.md).
