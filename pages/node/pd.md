# Full node: pd

This section describes how to build and run `pd`, the node implementation for
Penumbra.  This is not necessary to use Penumbra, but promotes decentralization
and allows deeper interactions with network data.

The [Tutorial](./pd/running-node.md) section has a quickstart tutorial for setting up `pd` on a bare metal server rented from a cloud provider.

The other pages describe running a node in detail:

- [Requirements](./pd/requirements.md) describes the compute resource necessary to run a Penumbra node;
- [Installing `pd`](./pd/install.md) describes how to install or build `pd`;
- [Joining a network](./pd/join-network.md) describes how to join an existing Penumbra network;
- [Becoming a validator](./pd/validator.md) describes how to become a validator and participate in consensus;
- [Indexing ABCI events](./pd/validator.md) describes how to ingest events into a database for further processing or analysis;

Finally, the [FAQs](./pd/debugging.md) page has frequently asked questions about running a node.
