# Compiling from source

Penumbra is written in [Rust]. To build it, you will need a recent
stable version of Rust, as well as a few OS-level dependencies.
We don't support building on Windows. If you need to use Windows,
consider using [WSL] instead.

This page aims to describe the steps necessary to work on Penumbra when
setting up the build environment manually.
If you want an easy-to-use setup, see the docs on [developer environments](./dev-env.mdx),
which uses [Nix].

### Installing the Rust toolchain

This requires that you install a recent (>= 1.75) stable version
of the Rust compiler, installation instructions for which you can find
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). Don't forget to reload your shell so that
`cargo` is available in your `$PATH`!

You can verify the rust compiler version by running `rustc --version` which should indicate version 1.75 or later.
The project uses a `rust-toolchain.toml` file, which will ensure that your version of rust stays current enough
to build the project from source.

### Installing build prerequisites

You must install some additional packages in order to build the Penumbra software,
depending on your distribution.

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components';

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Debian', 'Fedora']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
  xcode-select --install
  brew install git-lfs
  git lfs install
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev clang git-lfs
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
  sudo dnf install openssl-devel clang git cargo rustfmt git-lfs
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Cloning the repository

Once you have installed the above packages, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra
```

To build the versions of `pcli`, `pd`, etc. compatible with the current network,
navigate to the `penumbra/` folder, fetch the latest from the repository, and check out the
latest tag from the [releases page](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra/releases).
Currently, that tag is <code>{PENUMBRA_VERSION}</code>. Substitute that value for `<TAG>`
below:

```bash
cd penumbra && git fetch && git checkout <TAG>
```

If you want to build the most recent version compatible with the "preview" environment,
then run `git checkout main` instead.

### Building the binaries

Then, build all the project binaries using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Linking Against RocksDB (Optional)

Development builds can avoid the cost of recompiling RocksDB for storage libraries in the Cargo
workspace. This manifests as a `librocksdb-sys(build)` message when building or testing crates
in the monorepo.

#### Building `librocksdb.a` from source

First, clone the rocksdb repository:

```sh
# Clone the repository, and enter that directory.
git clone git@github.com:facebook/rocksdb.git && cd rocksdb

# Checkout the version of rocksdb used in `librocksdb-sys`.
git checkout 6a43615

# Add an environment variable pointing to this repository:
ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=`pwd`

# Compile the static `librocksdb.a` library to link against:
make static_lib
```

#### Building `libsnappy.a` from source

next, clone the snappy repository and follow the
[instructions][snappy-build] to build it:

```
# Clone the repository, and enter that directory.
git clone git@github.com:google/snappy.git && cd snappy

# Checkout the version of snappy used in `librocksdb-sys`.
git checkout 2b63814

# Initialize the submodules.
git submodule update --init

# Build snappy using cmake.
mkdir build
cd build && cmake ../ -DSNAPPY_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF && make

# Add an environment variable pointing to the build/ directory.
SNAPPY_LIB_DIR=`pwd`
```

### Building Penumbra

Once you've built rocksdb and set the environment variable, the `librocksdb-sys` crate will search
in that directory for the compiled `librocksdb.a` static library when it is rebuilt.
