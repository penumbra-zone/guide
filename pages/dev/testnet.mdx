# Testnet

There's a long-running testnet chain available, intended for developers
to test code and practice integrating their software with the Penumbra stack.

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸš§">
  The PL-run testnet was chain was reset on 2025-04-15.
  See notes below on compatibility.
</Callout>

## Compatibility
The current testnet chain `penumbra-testnet-phobos-3` was created on 2025-04-15.
It is running a candidate protocol upgrade related to [LQT], and as such, as is not compatible with mainnet.
In order to interact with the testnet, developers should build client software from the 
[`protocol/lqt_branch`](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra/tree/protocol/lqt_branch) for compatibility.

## Services available

The following public services are available:

| URL | Service |
| --- | --- |
| https://testnet.plinfra.net | primary `pd` gRPC endpoint, running most recently released stable tag from the [protocol repo] |
| https://testnet-preview.plinfra.net | secondary `pd` gRPC endpoint, running the most recent commit on the `main` branch in the [protocol repo] |
| https://dex-explorer.testnet.plinfra.net | a [DEX explorer](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/dex-explorer) instance, showing testnet market activity |
| https://cuiloa.testnet.plinfra.net | a block explorer, based on [cuiloa](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/cuiloa) |

## Joining the testnet

You can run a node on the public testnet like so:

```shell
# clean up any pre-existing network state
cargo run --release --bin pd -- network unsafe-reset-all
# generate network configs for the testnet chain
cargo run --release --bin pd -- network join http://testnet.plinfra.net:26657
```

That `network join` command will initialize node state directories locally.
Then fetch the most recent snapshot to backfill blocks from before the most
recent testnet chain upgrade:

```
curl -O https://artifacts.plinfra.net/penumbra-testnet-phobos-2/penumbra-node-archive-latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf penumbra-node-archive-latest.tar.gz -C ~/.penumbra/network_data/node0/
```

After that, if you've set up the [Penumbra developer environment](./dev-env.mdx),
you can run a fullnode locally via:

```shell
just dev
```

For a more persistent setup, consult the [tutorial on running a node](../network/node/pd/running-node.mdx).

## Running `pcli`

To interact with the chain, configure a wallet pointing at the testnet node:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- --home ~/.local/share/pcli-testnet view reset
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- init --grpc-url https://testnet.plinfra.net soft-kms generate
# or, to reuse an existing seed phrase:
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- init --grpc-url https://testnet.plinfra.net soft-kms import-phrase
```

and then pass the `--home` flag to any commands you run to point `pcli` at your local node, e.g.,

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- --home ~/.local/share/pcli-testnet view balance
```

You'll be able to run queries like `pcli query validator list`, but by default you won't be able
to create transactions, as an empty wallet will lack funds to pay gas fees.


## Obtaining funds on the testnet

Typically projects will provide a "faucet" bot that distributes testnet tokens for developers to use.
Penumbra works a bit differently. Given how central IBC connections to other chains are in Penumbra,
the recommended procedure to get funds on the testnet is to bridge in assets via IBC:

1. Install [Keplr]. It's OK to use the same seed phrase as on the Penumbra testnet.
2. View the [Noble testnet in Keplr](https://testnet.keplr.app/chains/noble-testnet) and click **Deposit**. Copy the address that's displayed to your clipboard.
3. Visit the [Circle testnet faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), select **Noble Testnet**, paste your address, and submit.
4. Install [Prax](../using-penumbra/web/prax.mdx). Configure the RPC endpoint to be `https://testnet.plinfra.net`.
5. Within Prax, click **Shield Funds**, choose **Deposit (Manual)**, and follow the prompts to transfer in the funds you received from the faucet.
6. After seeing a confirmation message, check **Assets** to see your newly bridged in assets.

You now have a balance on the testnet! You can try [swapping the asset](../using-penumbra/web/swap.mdx) for other tokens.
