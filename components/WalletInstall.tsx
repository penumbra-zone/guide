            Open it by clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar, select
            Create a new wallet. During the guided tutorial, you'll need to set
            a passphrase to protect your wallet. The passphrase is not the same
            as the recovery phrase. The passphrase is used to restrict access to
            the web wallet on your computer. The recovery phrase can be used to
            restore your wallet in case you forget your passphrase, switch to a
            new machine or delete the extension. Make sure to store both the
            passphrase and the recovery phrase securely, for example in a
            password manager. Re-enter portions of the recovery phrase when
            prompted, to confirm that you've saved it properly.

            data. It's all stored locally and securely on your device. To give a
            site permission to access your data, click the Connect button below.
